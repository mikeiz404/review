# Problem
There are 100 lockers.
All lockers start off closed.
A person walks by all lockers 100 times from locker 1 to locker 100.
On the first pass they toggle the state of all the lockers so that they are all open.
On the second pass they toggle the state of every other locker so that every other one is closed.
On the `nth` pass every `nth` locker is toggled.
They continue in this way until on the 100th pass the 100th locker's state is the only one toggled.
How many lockers are open when the person finishes?
