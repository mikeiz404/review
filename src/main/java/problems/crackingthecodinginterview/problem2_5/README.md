# Problem
Sum two numbers where each number is represented by a linked list where each node in the linked list represent a base 10 digit in reverse order. The sum should be returned in a similarly formatted linked list.

For example:
```
1234 -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
1337 -> [7, 3, 3, 1]

1234 + 1337 = 2571
[4, 3, 2, 1] + [7, 3, 3, 1] = [1, 7, 5, 2]
```
