# Problem
Given an array `a` of integers from `0..n` (unsorted) with one number removed, write a function to determine which number was removed.
However there is a catch. The integers in `a` cannot be accessed directly; Only a single bit position can be read from or written to at a time.
Bit reads and writes are done in constant time.
Try and find the number in O(n) time.
