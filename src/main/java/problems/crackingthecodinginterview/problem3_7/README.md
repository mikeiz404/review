# Problem
An animal shelter accepts dogs and cats. The shelter will only allow the oldest
animal to be adopted at a given time (FIFO). However a person can request that
the animal either be a dog or a cat, or both. Oldest is defined as time since
the animal was received at the shelter.

Write a data structure which can represent the functionality required for managing
the adoption of these animals. A linked-list is allowed.
