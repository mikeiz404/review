# Problem
A visitor comes to an island and dictates that all blue-eyed people must leave.
There will be a flight every day which can take as many people away as necessary.
People cannot be told their eye color.
There is at least one blue-eyed person on the island.
How many days will it take for all blue-eyed people to leave?
